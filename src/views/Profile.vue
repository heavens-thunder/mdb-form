     The New Zealand national cricket team represents New Zealand in men's international cricket.
      Nicknamed the Blackcaps, they played their first Test in 1930 against England in Christchurch, 
      becoming the fifth country to play Test cricket. From 1930 New Zealand had to wait until 1956,
       more than 26 years, for its first Test victory, against the West Indies at Eden Park in Auckland.
        They played their first ODI in the 1972â€“73 season against Pakistan in Christchurch.

The current captain in all formats of the game is Kane Williamson, who replaced Brendon McCullum
 after the latter's retirement in December 2015. The national team is organised by New Zealand Cricket.

The New Zealand cricket team became known as the Blackcaps in January 1998, after its sponsor at
 the time, Clear Communications, held a competition to choose a name for the team.
  This is one of many national team nicknames related to the All Blacks.

As of 10 March 2021, New Zealand have played 1360 international matches,
 winning 524, losing 611, tying 15 and drawing 166 matches while 44 matches
  ended as no result.[15] The team is ranked 2nd in Tests, 1st in ODIs and 3rd in T20Is by the ICC.
   New Zealand have reached two World Cup finals, in 2015 and 2019. They defeated South Africa in the
    semi final of the 2015 World Cup, which was their first win in the a world cup semi final, but they
     ultimately lost to Trans-Tasman rivals Australia.[17] In the next World Cup in 2019, New Zealand 
     again reached the final which they lost to the hosts England on boundary count after the match
      and the subsequent Super Over both ended as ties.
